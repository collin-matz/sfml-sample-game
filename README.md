# SFML Sample Game
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is an API used to create windows on the screen and draw to them. In this small example, we make a minimal viable product game that displays the core use of SFML, gets us warmed up to C++, and serves as the launching off point of game development!

## Tools we decided to use for this project
- Git, GitKraken (for code versioning, and because I've started to like the GitKraken visuals more recently!)
- C++ (Language of choice. Goal is to eventually move to plain C, but C++ might make things a little simpler at the start)
- VSCode (IDE of choice, this doesn't matter, but there are some key differences between IDEs like this and Visual Studio. Might switch later)
