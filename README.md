# SFML Sample Game
Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) is an API used to create windows on the screen and draw to them. In this small example, we make a minimal viable product game that displays the core use of SFML, gets us warmed up to C++, and serves as the launching off point of game development!

## Tools
- Git, GitKraken (for code versioning, and because I've started to like the GitKraken visuals more recently!)
- C++ (Language of choice. Goal is to eventually move to plain C, but C++ might make things a little simpler at the start)
- VSCode (IDE of choice, this doesn't matter, but there are some key differences between IDEs like this and Visual Studio. Might switch later)
- CMake (Build system for compiling the game. Not entirely sure if there is a better way, but this seems like the best approach, even for larger projects.)

## Goals
The goals of this project are defined as follows:
1. Above all else, become acquainted with C++ and CMake. These are invaluable skills that apply to nearly every sector of programming. Becoming comfortable with configuring and building a C++ project will make you a better programmer.
2. Become acquainted with version tracking systems (Git). This team will be using GitHub for code tracking. Similar to the point above, this is an essential skill outside of these projects, so learn how to use these types of systems well.
3. Become acquainted with SFML. SFML is going to be the backbone of the game development tech stack this team uses for the foreseeable future, so understanding how to open windows, render graphics, audio, and all of its other features are going to help a lot moving forwards.

<u>Stretch Goals</u>:

- Get started with OpenGL. If the basics come easier than anticipated, we can begin working with OpenGL sooner rather than later. I am okay to not rush this step since we are trying to build a foundation with this project.
